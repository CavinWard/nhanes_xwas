## Implement code to execute an X-wide association study (XWAS)! 
- Starter code to execute an X-wide association study (XWAS) analysis
- X-wide association study (XWAS) is a data-driven method to find what variables in the set 'X' are associated with a phenotype (call it Y, e.g., telomere length)
- Identify exposure variables associated with telomere length in NHANES 1999-2002 participants (as published in Patel CJ, IJE 2016)
- Originally presented at ISEE/ISES 2018, Ottawa, Canada on August 26 2018
