## Implement code to execute an X-wide association study (XWAS)! 
- we will implement starter code to execute an X-wide association study (XWAS) analysis to  exposure variables associated with telomere length in NHANES 1999-2002 participants
- X-wide association study (XWAS) is a data-driven method to find what variables in the set 'X' are associated with a phenotype (call it Y, e.g., telomere length)
- What are telomeres?: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere
